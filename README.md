# restful-api-database
A RESTful API Database Integration refers to the process of connecting a web application with a database using a REST (Representational State Transfer) API. This architecture allows for seamless communication between the client and server, enabling data to be created, read, updated, and deleted (CRUD operations) over HTTP protocols.
